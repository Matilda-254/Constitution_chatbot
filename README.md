# Constitution_chatbot
This project is a chatbot that helps people understand the Constitution of Kenya. Instead of reading the whole document, you can just ask a question in normal English and the chatbot will give you an answer, together with the part of the Constitution it comes from.

It is built using AI tools that can understand text and find similar meanings. This makes it easier to search through the Constitution and get clear answers.
